"MCAS, Autism/ADHD","TPSAB1","rs1861759","Preliminary/unconfirmed; alpha tryptase CNV is main known factor","Claimed Neanderthal","User-cited duplication variant. Main evidence is for hereditary alpha tryptasemia rather than autism/ADHD. Minimal mainstream support."
"MCAS, Autism/ADHD","TPSAB1","rs113578744","Preliminary/unconfirmed; alpha tryptase CNV is main known factor","Claimed Neanderthal","Same gene duplication rationale as rs1861759. MCAS-like symptoms can result from extra copies of alpha tryptase; data on ADHD/autism link are speculative."
"MCAS, Autism/ADHD","TPSAB1","rs140863677","Strong association with hereditary alpha tryptasemia","Claimed Neanderthal","Found in individuals with elevated tryptase levels; associated with MCAS-like symptoms."
"MCAS, Autism/ADHD, POTS","ADRA1A","rs1048101","Preliminary; alpha-adrenergic receptor SNP linked to autonomic dysfunction","Claimed Neanderthal","Weakly associated with POTS and autonomic dysregulation."
"POTS, MCAS, Lupus, RA","HLA-B","rs144921697","Preliminary/unconfirmed; MHC region well known in autoimmunity","Claimed Neanderthal","HLA-B is implicated in autoimmune disease, but specific SNP evidence is less established for POTS/MCAS."
"POTS, MCAS, Lupus, RA","HLA-B","rs17878979","Preliminary/unconfirmed; MHC region well known in autoimmunity","Claimed Neanderthal","Similar commentary as rs144921697. MHC variants can influence broad autoimmunity risk."
"MCAS, Autism/ADHD, MS","IL2RA","rs2104286","Known association with autoimmune conditions (e.g., T1D, MS)","Claimed Neanderthal","IL2RA (CD25) is crucial in immune regulation. Clear link with MS; MCAS/autism associations are not well established."
"EDS/hEDS","COL5A1","rs12721431","Preliminary/unconfirmed; possible collagen regulation SNP","Claimed Neanderthal","COL5A1 is central in classical EDS; hEDS genetics remain elusive. Minimal data on this specific rs."
"EDS/hEDS, Fibromyalgia","TGFB2","rs2272785","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Neanderthal","TGFB2 variants known in some connective tissue disorders (e.g., Loeys-Dietz), but data for hEDS/fibromyalgia are sparse."
"EDS/hEDS, Fibromyalgia","TGFB1","rs1800469","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Neanderthal","Promoter polymorphism C-509T in TGFB1; some small studies tie it to fibrosis or chronic pain. Not definitively validated for hEDS."

"EDS/hEDS, POTS, Autism/ADHD","ACTN3","rs7308816","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Viking","Less-studied ACTN3 SNP. â€˜Viking originâ€™ is speculative, primarily associated with athletic performance studies."
"EDS/hEDS, POTS, MCAS","NOS1AP","rs6944656","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Viking","NOS1AP studied mostly in QT-interval and diabetic neuropathy. â€˜Viking Diseaseâ€™ typically refers to Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture; tenuous link here."
"EDS/hEDS, POTS, MCAS","NOS1AP","rs28931567","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Viking","Same gene as rs6944656, limited mainstream evidence for EDS, POTS, MCAS association."
"Autism/ADHD, MCAS, Fibromyalgia","MC1R","rs1805007","Common red-hair variant, minimal direct link to these disorders","Claimed Neanderthal","MC1R variants sometimes associated with altered pain sensitivity. â€˜Neanderthal originâ€™ is a popular myth, not firmly established."
"Autism/ADHD, MCAS, Fibromyalgia","COMT","rs4680","Widely studied in psychiatric/pain contexts","Claimed Neanderthal","Val158Met influences dopamine metabolism, pain, cognition. Some archaic haplotypes in COMT, but details remain unclear."

"Autism/ADHD, MCAS, Fibromyalgia","SLC6A4","rs25531","Promoter polymorphism near 5-HTTLPR","Claimed Neanderthal","Involved in serotonin transporter function. Many inconsistent links to neuropsychiatric or pain disorders."
"Autism/ADHD, MCAS, Fibromyalgia","DRD4","rs1800955","Promoter SNP, ADHD association replicated","Claimed Neanderthal","DRD4 is a well-known ADHD gene (especially 7R VNTR). Direct MCAS/fibro link is not widely established."
"Autism/ADHD, MCAS, Fibromyalgia","GABRA2","rs3729984","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Neanderthal","GABRA2 variants studied in addiction/psychiatric traits. Limited data for MCAS/fibro."
"ALS, MS, Lupus, RA","APOE","rs769449","Preliminary/unconfirmed for these autoimmune/ALS contexts","Claimed Neanderthal","APOE Îµ4 is well known for Alzheimerâ€™s risk, some small association signals in MS/ALS, not firmly validated."
"ALS, MS, Lupus, RA","TP53","rs1042522","Arg72Pro variant with cancer relevance, minimal direct link here","Claimed Neanderthal","Occasionally studied in neurodegeneration or autoimmune, but data are not conclusive."
"MS, Lupus, RA, Fibromyalgia","VDR","rs731236","â€˜BsmIâ€™ variant in vitamin D receptor","Claimed Neanderthal","Vitamin D pathways widely studied in autoimmune disorders. Conflicting or modest results across diseases."
"MS, Lupus, RA, Fibromyalgia","HSP70 (HSPA1A)","rs2075800","Preliminary/unconfirmed","Claimed Neanderthal","Heat shock proteins can modulate inflammation. Some studies link HSP70 SNPs to autoimmune severity."
"MS, Lupus, RA, Fibromyalgia","IFITM3","rs12252","Preliminary/unconfirmed; known for infection susceptibility","Claimed Neanderthal","IFITM3 primarily studied for viral infections (influenza/COVID-19). Autoimmune/fibro links are less established."
